<h1>3D Computer Graphics</h1>
A tutorial I followed (https://pikuma.com/courses) to create 3d animations from scratch. It went pretty deep into the math of projection and shading using interpolation and barycentric coordinates.

It was programmed in C using the SDL API. Apart from following the tutorial, I did a little refactoring of some of the functions to help it make more sense to me.
